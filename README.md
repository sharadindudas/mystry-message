# Mystry Message

Mystry Message is a web application that enables users to send and receive anonymous messages. Users can log in, share their unique link to receive anonymous messages, or use someone else’s link to send them an anonymous message. The app keeps all identities hidden for a secure and private experience.

## Demo

-   **Anonymous Messaging**: Users can receive anonymous messages by sharing their link and send messages using others' links, all while keeping identities hidden.
-   **Secure Authentication**: Only logged-in users can send or receive messages.
-   **Real-Time Storage**: Uses MongoDB and Redis to handle data efficiently.
-   **Modern UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN for a sleek and responsive design.
